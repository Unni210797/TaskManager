I have developed a simple task management system using ASP .NET MVC. 
The application utilizes the Entity Framework Code First approach to connect to the database and performed CRUD operations.
Additionally, I have implemented user authorization and validation using Identity classes. 
For improved user experience, I have incorporated AJAX for data filtering.
